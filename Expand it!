### **How to Expand**  
1. **More Actions**: Add `"attack"` or `"transform"` (for Super Sonic).  
2. **Zones**: Use a dictionary to track zones and their hazards.  
3. **Graphics**: Use `pygame` for a simple 2D version.  

Would you like me to adapt this for another language (e.g., JavaScript) or add more complex mechanics? ðŸŽ®
